# Setup instructions for windows

Go to https://www.anaconda.com/download/

Switch to the macOS or Linux tabs if applicable

Click download Python version 3.7

Run the executable

Follow the setup wizard. I recommend keeping all the default settings. Install will take about 10-15 mins.

Skip visual basic code unless you really want it. Uncheck learn more/learn how and finish.

Launch Jupyter Notebook. Opens in your default browser. May take a few seconds.

# Opening a workbook

If you want to ignore git stuff and just get started with a workbook...

Click the green clone or download button, click download zip on the drop down.

Unzip contents into a destination of your choice. I recommend Desktop or Documents. This avoids the need to modify jupyter configurations.

Open Jupyter Notebook in your web browser. You should see a folder directory. Navigate to the unzipped folder. If you can't find it, move the folder to a recognizable location based on what you see in Juypter. Or click "upload" and upload the files.

Click on a workbook to open it. eg basics.ipynb
